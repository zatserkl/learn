Description: Extreme ultraviolet lithography (EUVL) is the principal lithography technology aiming to manufacture computer chips beyond the current 193-nm-based optical lithography, and recent progress has been made on several fronts: EUV light sources, optics, optics metrology, contamination control, masks and mask handling, and resists.
This comprehensive volume is comprised of contributions from the world's leading EUVL researchers and provides all of the critical information needed by practitioners and those wanting an introduction to the field.

Interest in EUVL technology continues to increase, and this volume provides the foundation required for understanding and applying this exciting technology.
